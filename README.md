 <!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
  When the quiz is conducted on Google Form, Google does not provide an option for computing -ve marking. It gives 0
marks for wrong answer. It just gives a csv file as output for post processing.So I made a web
based interface that will have such an option.

we'll get a .csv file from Google Form that contains marks for each roll number and the individual options marked by each student.
Timestamp: At what time student submitted their question paper.
Email address: Email address to which student login.
Score: Total calculated score.
Name: Name of the student.
IITP webmail: IITP webmail address.
Phone number: Phone number of the student
Roll Number: Roll number of the student.
